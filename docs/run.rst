The simplest way to access the functionalities of the OrbitPy package is by defining a JSON file with the mission specifications
 (named as ``MissionSPecs.json``).
The ``run_mission.py`` script can be invoked with the argument as the user-directory (in which the JSON file is situated).

*Example*

.. code_block:: javascript
