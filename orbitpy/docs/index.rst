Welcome to OrbitPy's documentation!
===================================

Install
========
*Requires:* Unix-like operating system (currently tested in Ubuntu 18.04.03), :code:`python 3.8`, :code:`gcc`, :code:`gfortran`

1. Make sure the :code:`instrupy` package (dependency) has been installed. It can be installed by running :code:`make` in the :code:`instruments/instrupy/` directory.
2. Navigate to the :code:`orbits/oc/` directory and run :code:`make`. 
3. Navigate to the :code:`orbits/orbitpy/` directory and run :code:`make`.
4. Execute :code:`make runtest` to run tests and verify *OK* message.
5. Run an example, by running the following command from the :code:`orbits` directory: :code:`python orbitpy/bin/run_mission.py orbitpy/examples/example1/`.
   See the results in the :code:`orbitpy/examples/example1/` folder. Description of the examples in given in :ref:`examples` page.

Description
===========

This package contain set of modules to compute orbit data of satellites. It performs the following functions:

1. Computation of satellite state (position and velocity) data.
2. Generation of grid-of-points at a (user-defined or auto) angular resolution.
3. Computation of Field Of Regard (FOR) based on the manueverability and sensor specifications, mounting.
4. Computation of satellite access intervals over given set of grid points for the length of the mission. 
5. Computation of inter-satellite communication time intervals.
6. Computation of ground-station contact time intervals.

With respect to integration in DSHIELD, the outputs/ functions of the package are used by other modules
of DSHIELD as follows:

.. csv-table:: Integration to other modules
   :header: "Data output", "the other module"
   :widths: 20, 20

   "Satellite States, Grid Points", "ACS module"
   "Intersatellite comms", "Comm Module"
   "Ground-station comms", "Ground module"
   "Access Opps with Observation quality", "Planner"

The input to the first three items is straightforward and can be used directly from the current implemnetation. The last item
however has issues. The raw access outputs are naive, and need to be filtered, post-processed to imaging oppurtunities (**raw access vs imaging opps**).     

Consider a 5 second mission, the desired output from the Orbits to the Planner would be as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   Time, (Grid-points, Observation Quality)
   1,    (10,2) (45,1) (100,1) (210,4) 
   2,    (10,3) (45,2) (100,2) (210,3) 
   3,    (10,4) (45,3) (100,3) (210,2) 
   4,    (10,3)        (100,4) (210,1) 
   5,    (10,1)        (100,5)  


Where a observation is defined as taking an image/ reading around the respective ground-point:

.. figure:: valid_vs_invalid_obs.png
    :scale: 75 %
    :align: center

    Valid vs Invalid observations

A similar issue exists in the time domain:

.. code-block:: bash

   Time,Access,Imaging Opp
   98,No, No     
   99,No, No   
   100,Yes, No   
   101,Yes, No   
   102,Yes, No
   103,Yes, Yes iff t= 104, are free
   104,Yes, Yes iff t= 103, 105 are free
   105,Yes, Yes iff t=103, 104, 106 are free

Issues
========

Issue #1
^^^^^^^^

Current implementation works well only for:
   1. Instruments whose required observation time < propagation step-size (i.e. < 1s).  For scanning type instruments 
      (like pushbroom sensors, stripmap SARs) this condition can be waived. But cannot be waived instruments like Matrix imagers, radiometers 
      which require the entire sensor FOV to be focused on the scene. 
   2. Whose FOV << FOR.

*First one is not realistic if the minimum exposure/ dwell time of instruments 
(required in radiometers) is to be considered. Second one is not realistic assumption for 
instruments having a wide-swath.*

The access file generated by the orbit and coverage is quite naive. It indicates if the ground-point can be accessed at some instant of time.
However, what we require are the imaging oppourtunities, where a imaging opportunity is defined as:

*Outlier grid-points:* The area around the grid-point should be able to be observed, not just the point. Not realistic for instruments with large FOV.

.. figure:: outlier_grid_points.png
    :scale: 75 %
    :align: center

    Issue of the outlier grid-points

Issue #2
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* The area around the ground-point is not the same at each observation, especially for rectangular FOV sensors.

.. figure:: different_observation_areas.png
    :scale: 75 %
    :align: center

    Issue of the different observation areas.
